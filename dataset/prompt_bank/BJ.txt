BJ500 dataset: The data consists of 500 selected stop data distributed in the BeiJing Highway System (CalTrans). The data set time interval is a time interval of 5 minutes. The time range is in 2020-07-01 00:00:00 2020-07-31 23:55:00 weekdays of 500 stations traffic speed information, data shows a strong periodicity. The input consists of adjacency matrix and timing feature matrix. The adjacency matrix is a new matrix with similar traffic flow patterns by analyzing the characteristics of existing spatio-temporal traffic data, and the characteristic matrix is the time series ch Tr03aracteristic matrix of each sensor node.
